    "# Assignment: MTA Arrival Clock\n",
    "\n",
    "In the \"MTA Arrival Clock\" case study, we have created an alternative design to visualize the arrival time information that looks at the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3606672/246465520-5b7cad68-4722-4192-ad69-d0916c8f9cea.svg\" width=400/></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted in the case study, it has the following drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Only trains arriving within the next 10 min are displayed.\n",
    "* When two or more trains have the same arrival time, the subway line symbols and corresponding annotations will overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, your task is to come up with a new design that addresses at least one of the two aforementioned drawbacks. You can either use the existing dot plot design or come up with a complete new design. The requirements of the design is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The dimension of the visualization is fixed (833x200).\n",
    "* The design should make it easy to extract the arrival time information for each of the upcoming trains.\n",
    "* The arrival time information should be legible from afar.\n",
    "* Be mindful about utilizing the available spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please use this notebook for this assignment."
