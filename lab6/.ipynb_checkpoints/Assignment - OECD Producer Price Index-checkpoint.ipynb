    "# Assignment: OECD Producer Price Index\n",
    "\n",
    "The [producer price index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer_price_index) (PPI) measures the rate of change of price for products sold as they leave the producer. [OECD](http://oecd.org/), an intergovernmental organization, maintains a dataset of PPI for countries around the world. In this assignment, you will visualize the PPI of various countries from Jan 2011 to Jan 2023 as high dimensional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "* [PPI dataset](https://data.oecd.org/price/producer-price-indices-ppi.htm#indicator-chart)\n",
    "\n",
    "The important columns of this dataset are `LOCATION`, `TIME` and `Value`. We will treat the per-country PPI values over time as a single data point. I.e. Each high dimension data point consists of all the values from Jan 2011 to Jan 2023 for a given country. You may want to use `pandas.pivot` to switch the data frame from long form to wide form. For this assignment, we will replace all `NaN` values by 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task for this assignment is to find a two-dimensional embedding of this high dimensional dataset that clusters countries with similar PPI value history together. The final visualization should be a 2D scatter plot. The x and y axis should map to the components computed from the dimension reduction algorithm.  The location information should be encoded as color.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please use this notebook for this assignment."
